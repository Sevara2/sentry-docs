The **Issue Details** page for performance issues helps you to gain further insight into the source of the issue and the impact it has on your application's users. The main area of the page displays information about a specific transaction event that's part of an issue. The top panel and right-hand sidebar of the page display a summary of all the events grouped together in this issue.

<Note>

You can find performance issues by searching `issue.category:performance` in **Issues**, **Discover** and **Dashboards**.

While the **Issue Details** page displays information about a specific transaction event that's part of an issue, you can navigate between the events of an issue using the "Older" and "Newer" buttons. You'll see information about the issue as well as the details of the most recent event. You'll be able to see the summary of when the issue was seen, a breakdown of the tags, and breadcrumbs if they are available.

## How Performance Issues Work

A performance issue is very similar to a regular error-based issue. Sentry creates performance issues by grouping suspicious transactions. A suspicious transaction has the following elements:

<!-- describe what this is and add any other info about how we group -->

## Tags

Tags are key/value string pairs that are both indexed and searchable. For example, a tag provides you with information such as the browser, device, or user associated with the event. Tags are the diagnostic information sent by the SDK for the individual event.

The tags displayed in the main section of this page are specific to the event that you're viewing. In contrast, the tags displayed in the right-hand sidebar are a summary of all tag values for all events included in the issue. You can set your own tags to make them more useful for debugging as described in Customize Tags.

## Span Evidence

The "Span Evidence" section that shows information about the issue's cause, and a span tree that highlights the spans involved in the issue.

The "Span Evidence" section highlights the key information about the issue. This includes details about the event and the spans that caused the issue, depending on the issue type. The Span Tree is a visual representation of the spans involved in the issue.

## Performance Issue Limitations

Performance issues have a few limitations:

- Sentry only detects one type of issue: [N+1 Queries](n-one-queries)
- You cannot create alerts for performance issues
- Performance issues cannot be merged or deleted
- Custom fingerprinting and grouping do not apply to performance issues
- Performance issues only support simple ignore rules
